/*
 * libredwood-media.dylib: code of ours inside mediaserverd (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 * redfin: this file is HackiOS's (MIT, LICENSE.HackiOS; hackios-xnu-userland a79ff07 userland/src/inject_media.c), built
 * into RedwoodAudio.driver, which mediaserverd loads as a HAL plug-in: no injection needed. Changed for the
 * iPhone X's iOS 16.7.x on the Pixel 5: no iOS 16.5 addresses are trusted (methods replaced by class and selector;
 * the Metal device list and FigFlashlight's callers left alone), the flashlight is sysctl kern.sweet_torch.
 *
 * mediaserverd is the audio server, and also the camera's: the capture stack of CMCapture lives
 * in the same process. Soon after it starts, that stack "prewarms" the Core Image filters of the
 * portrait mode, for which Core Image wants an OpenGL ES context; there is no GPU, the context
 * has no functions behind it, and the daemon jumps to address 0 -- every time launchd restarts
 * it. Nobody is going to take a portrait here: the prewarming is skipped.
 *
 * What the daemon is wanted for meanwhile is neither sound nor the camera: it is where
 * VideoToolbox decodes for everybody else (the service com.apple.coremedia.decompressionsession),
 * and a HEIC picture is HEVC inside. Without the daemon ImageIO has "no way to decode a HEIC",
 * and the stock wallpaper of iOS 16, whose layers are four such pictures, is its gradient alone.
 * There is no hardware decoder here; VideoToolbox takes its software one (VCPHEVC.videocodec).
 *
 * The flashlight (only where the kernel has one: torch=3, /dev/redwood-torch): Control Center's
 * button and AVFlashlight reach FigFlashlight in here, which asks the capture stack's device vendor
 * (+[BWFigCaptureDeviceVendor sharedCaptureDeviceVendor]) for the camera device and its back
 * camera's stream, and sets the stream's "TorchLevel" (0 to 1). Without a camera there is no
 * vendor (it is nil), every message to it does nothing, and FigFlashlight says it has set the level
 * when nothing has been. So where there is no vendor, FigFlashlight -- and only FigFlashlight,
 * by where it calls from -- is given one of ours, with a device and a stream whose torch level goes
 * to the kernel (see flashlight_*() below). Everybody else still gets none, as before.
 *
 * The camera (only where the kernel has one: cam=5, /dev/redwood-camera): the vendor is made for
 * everybody, with the create function of our capture device (camera_device.c) in place of the
 * one H10ISP.mediacapture would give for the iPhone's ISP; the capture graph is built around it and
 * its frames reach Camera.app's preview (see camera_device.c). Its stream takes the torch level too,
 * so FigFlashlight would need nothing of its own then (not tried yet).
 *
 * What the capture stack asks of hardware this phone has none of is refused here: there is no ISP
 * processing session, so there can be no video stabilization (see video_stabilization_method below).
 *
 * CMCapture is not loaded yet when this library is: the methods are replaced when its image
 * arrives.

/* ---- the Metal device leaves this process before the capture stack asks for it -------------------- */

/*
 * With the Metal properties on the accelerator service (boot-arg metal=1) MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()
 * answers in every process, and in mediaserverd the first to ask is the capture stack: CMCapture's
 * FigPreloadShadersInternal reaches -[_MTLDevice newLibraryWithURL:error:] through three functions of
 * AppleCVAPhoto, asking for System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AppleCVAPhoto.framework/Resources/
 * cvadepth-iOS.metallib. That file is not in this image (ios165/select-system.py drops .metallib under
 * the framework directories), so the URL is nil and Metal aborts on `url must not be nil' -- twenty-eight
 * times in one boot, launchd restarting the daemon after each (logs/135751-run.log, docs/metal.md 10.38).
 * AppleCVAPhoto itself survives a library it cannot make: it checks the result and logs "Error creating
 * metal library". What kills the process is Metal's own assertion, and that is reached only because there
 * IS a device to send the message to.
 *
 * So the device is taken out of this process, exactly as inject.c does for the window server: Metal keeps
 * every device it has made in one static NSMutableArray (0x1e1efe9a0, __DATA_DIRTY.__bss, so one per
 * process), and MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() is no more than "if that array holds exactly one object,
 * return it" -- an empty array answers nil without a single instruction of Metal's being touched. The
 * array is built on first use, so it has to be asked for first; that makes the device object, which is
 * what the capture stack's next instruction would have done anyway, so the process pays nothing new.
 * The device is retained and never released, for inject.c's reason: what our -dealloc would do to a GPU
 * is not measured.
 *
 * WHEN, and why not where inject.c does it. There the hook is -[CAWindowServer _detectDisplays], the last
 * Objective-C method on the way in and an address that can be checked. Here the way in is three C
 * functions of AppleCVAPhoto with no method of ours to stand on, so this runs from the add-image notifier
 * this library already registers, the first time Metal is in the process at all -- which is before any
 * code of the image that brought it has run. Being early cannot cost correctness: if the device can be
 * made, it is made and removed; if the accelerator service is not matched yet and the array is built
 * empty, nil is what the capture stack gets, and nil is the whole point.
 *
 * Boot-arg mediamtl=1 leaves the device where it is. It is a switch of its own and not inject.c's camtl=1
 * because the two processes do not risk the same thing: a window server that aborts is a crash loop and a
 * black screen, while mediaserverd aborting costs HEIC decoding, the camera and the sound. A boot may
 * reasonably want Metal in one and not the other. Either way the metallib has to be in the image first,
 * or the same assertion comes straight back.
